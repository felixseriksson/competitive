Goldbach's weak conjecture: every odd integer >= 5 can be written as the sum of 3 primes
38399, 12803, 33497, 22847, 12383
have factors
19*43*47, 7*31*59, 19*41*43, 11*31*67, 7*29*61
"When all factors are taken into account, you realize that it only makes sense when you take the sum of its parts"
so we take sums of factors and find that they are
109, 97, 103, 109, 97, or
